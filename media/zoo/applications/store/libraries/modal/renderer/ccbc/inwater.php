		<h4>Here are a couple of reasons why the Center Console Boat Cover is not intended for in water use.</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="uk-width-1-1">
		<ul class="">
			<li>
				<p>It is extremely difficult to install the Center Console Boat Cover while your boat is in the water.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The Center Console Boat Cover does not have cleat cutouts for the ability to tie the boat to the pier.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A majority of our Center Console Boat Covers extend past the chime of the boat which is below the water line in most cases.  This will cause the fabric to be submerged.</p>

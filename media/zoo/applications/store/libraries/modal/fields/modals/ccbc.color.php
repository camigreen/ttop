		<p>Our solution dyed, 100% polyester covers are offered in three weights, 7oz., 8oz. or 9 oz. per linear yard. The 7oz. cover has a three year warranty and a urethane coating on the inside to give it water resistance properties and it should hold up to UV rays an estimated 4-5 years. The 8oz. cover is extremely breathable, it has a five year warranty and should hold up to UV rays an estimated 7-9 years. The 9oz. cover is extremely breathable, it has a five year warranty and should hold up to UV rays an estimated 10 years. The color is introduced into the polyester when it is in its solution state. This means that the color runs throughout the diameter of the fiber so it will not rub off or bleed onto the boat. We like to use the polyester material because it is lightweight, will not stretch or hardly fade in color over the life of the material.</p>
